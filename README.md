# Rapid-Heal-Flick-NMZ

A sloppily written clicker in Java.
## Features
- Random interval between clicks for both up-strokes, down-strokes and between flicks.
- Intervals based on human click intervals (mine lol, a filthy casual)
## How to use it
1. Bring absorption potions
2. Go into NMZ and max up on absorption
3. Rock cake your health down to 1
4. Start the included Jar file
5. Mouse over your rapid heal prayer
6. Voila
## Don'ts
- DO NOT USE IT OVER NIGHT the bot won't stop flicking when you die.
## Dos
- Check on it regularly to see that you haven't run out of absorption. Just stop the bot and fill up on absorption and start it again.
# Use at your own risk.
I've personally used it for 20h+ without any repercussions. I highly doubt this will become popular enough to be detected by the botting system.
